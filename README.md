# About the project
At Tilburg Science Hub, we have a total of almost 400 pages. A lot of them had broken links in there which needed to be fixed. To check for these broken links, we made a script that checks for broken links and adds an isue citing all broken links and their specified locations

# Prerequisites
In order to be able to run the script, you need to install the following libraries:
- pip install usp
- pip install bs4

# Installation
1. Generate your Github API key in Profile Settings.
Warning: in order to post issues, make sure to click the possibility to write.

2. Store your API key as an environment variable called 'GIT_TOKEN'.

3. Clone the repository.
